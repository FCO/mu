dalek now supports push notifications for github repositories.  All
users who can are encouraged to switch to them; they are faster, use
less resources, and do not require listing branches.

1. Open your repository GitHub page.

2. Click the "Admin" button.

3. Select "Service Hooks".

4. Select "Post-Receive URLs".

5. Enter http://host04.appflux.net:5000/dalek?t=freenode,perl6 into the
   "URL" box and click "Update Settings".

   For other channels, adjust the URL correspondingly, for instance
   magnet,parrot .  Note that you cannot just enter any channel; dalek
   must be configured to join the channel first - contact sorear or
   diakopter.

   If you want announcements in more than one channel, use a link such
   as http://host04.appflux.net:5000/dalek?t=freenode,perl6+magnet,parrot .

6. Use the test function.

7. Remove your entry from dalek-conf.json, if needed.
