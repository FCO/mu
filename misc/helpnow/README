=head1 IDEAS

    Fix up a test file

    Port a smallish module
        - Log::Message
        - Text::Wrap
        - Text::Soundex (but wait until Str.trans is implemented)

    Implement $smallish_feature in $implementation

    Fix $bug in $implementation
        - Right now, Rakudo fails to handle the case when &infix:<op>() doesn't exist
        and you do "my $a; $a op= $b;"  This needs both a good test and a fix.

    Write documentation/examples for $function/$feature

    Implement $*ARGFILES (see S02 for description).

    Implement Match.new that accepts the Match.perl output

    Others:

# vim: spell ft=pod
