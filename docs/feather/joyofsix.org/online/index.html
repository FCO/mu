    <h1>The Joy of (Perl) Six</h1>


<p>Yeah, yeah we know. We should already be finished. We should have
gotten things done. You're' all giddy with anticipation. We too.</p>

<p>Think about Rakudo * as well - feature foreplay.  Until you get the
real deal, you'll dance around it, do some "programming by teasing",
while you can't have the real feature (yet), you'll have to work
around it. That's mean, we know.</p>

<p>But it also means you learn a lot more about the language than just
getting straight to the proper solution.  It'll also teach us patience
and searching for just another idea how to solve problem X or Y.</p>

<p>It's also true though that certain things just can't be coded right
now, because you can't work around something essential missing.</p>

<p>On the other hand: Maybe it encourages you to participate by just
adding the missing essentials?</p>

<p>If you have doubts whether you want to give Six some love - just try
it, we basically guarantee new heights of joy and pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Really talking programming. We promise. Honestly.  :)</em></p>
