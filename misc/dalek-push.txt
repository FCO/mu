dalek now supports push notifications for github repositories.  All
users who can are encouraged to switch to them; they are faster, use
less resources, and do not require listing branches.

1. Open your repository GitHub page.

2. Click the "Settings" button.

3. Select "Webhooks & Services".

4. Select "Add webhook"

5. Enter http://hack.p6c.org:8088/dalek?t=freenode,perl6 into the
   "Payload URL" box, choose "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" from "Content type" box and click "Add webhook".

   For other channels, adjust the URL correspondingly, for instance
   magnet,parrot .  Note that you cannot just enter any channel; dalek
   must be configured to join the channel first - contact sorear or
   diakopter.

   If you want announcements in more than one channel, use a link such
   as http://hack.p6c.org:8088/dalek?t=freenode,perl6+magnet,parrot .
