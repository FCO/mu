This week's contribution to Perl 6

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Each week we pose a challenge to the general public: one contribution to
Perl 6 that's achievable for a newcomer.

=head1 IDEAS

    Port a smallish module
        - Log::Message
        - Text::Wrap
        - Text::Soundex (but wait until Str.trans is implemented)

    Implement $smallish_feature in $implementation

    Fix $bug in $implementation
        - Right now, Rakudo fails to handle the case when &infix:<op>() doesn't exist
        and you do "my $a; $a op= $b;"  This needs both a good test and a fix.
        (might not be as trivial as initially thought)

    Write documentation/examples for $function/$feature (needs infrastructure
    first)

    Implement Match.new that accepts the Match.perl output (mostly done, only
    hard parts left)
