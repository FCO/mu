(partially taken from last year)

- native types
- is everything a reference?
- gather and coroutines are equal in power
- show off some nice modules
- sockets
- show off Date/DateTime
- lexical imports
- multi subs and methods -- how the spec puts user-defined ones on equal footing with built-in ones
- roles, role conflicts, and disambiguators (DrunkenGymnast!)
- cool things you can do with bigints and/or rats
- neat tricks for working with lazy lists
- overview of available, useful modules with small example programs
- learning resources (where do people find help?)
- review where we're at with Perl 6 (not just Rakudo)
- Perl 5/Perl 6 comparison (pick a nice problem or two and hilight the
  differences.  Rosettacode?)
- idiomatic Perl 6 (useful, common idioms)
- A look at Niecza 
- nci
- nom-based Rakudo Star!
- operator precedence
- dynamic subs: perfect for DSL-y things
- stuff Niecza does that Rakudo will do
    - library interfacing
    - ENTER/LEAVE phasers
    - Pseudo packages (MY, OUR, CORE, GLOBAL, etc.)
- "porting" a module from one implementation to another

Already planned or written about:
- Grammar::Debugger
- Buf and binary IO
- flip flop operator
- Tetris in Niecza
- Traits
- Grammar::Profiler riff off of Grammar::Debugger
- ecosystem update (panda, feature matrix, etc. What didn't exist last year?)
- meta-programming
- Modelbrot & Gtk
- pod6
- Bailador (Dancer port)
