dalek now supports push notifications for github repositories.  All
users who can are encouraged to switch to them; they are faster, use
less resources, and do not require listing branches.

1. Open your repository GitHub page.

2. Click the "Settings" button.

3. Select "Webhooks & Services".

4. Select "Add webhook"

5. Enter http://feather3.perl6.nl:5000/dalek?t=freenode,perl6 into the
   "Payload URL" box, choose "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" from "Content type" box and click "Add webhook".

   For other channels, adjust the URL correspondingly, for instance
   magnet,parrot .  Note that you cannot just enter any channel; dalek
   must be configured to join the channel first - contact sorear or
   diakopter.

   If you want announcements in more than one channel, use a link such
   as http://feather3.perl6.nl:5000/dalek?t=freenode,perl6+magnet,parrot .

6. Use the test function.

7. Remove your entry from dalek-conf.json, if needed.

   The post-receive script for dalek and the timed poll script do not
   communicate to prevent duplicate reports.  If both of them are set
   up to watch the same repository, all commits will be reported twice.
   Therefore, if there is an existing entry for the poll, it needs to
   be removed after post-receive is configured.
