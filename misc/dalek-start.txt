So you want to start up dalek?  Ok.

1. Log into hack.p6c.org under account dalek.  moritz will add your ssh key
   there if you ask.

2. 'tmux attach' or 'tmux', whichever works.  'screen' would work too, but I
   prefer tmux.

3. Start the 2 parts of dalek in separate windows:

3a: The IRC component:
    cd ~/dalek; while true; do perl botnix --debug; sleep 30; done

3b: The HTTP stub for receiving push notifications:
    cd ~/dalek/dalek-poller; starman --listen :8088 push.psgi

4. Detach and log out.
