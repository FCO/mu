=head1 IDEAS

    Fix up a test file

    Port a smallish module
        - Log::Message

    Implement $smallish_feature in $implementation

    Fix $bug in $implementation
        - Right now, Rakudo fails to handle the case when &infix:<op>() doesn't exist
        and you do "my $a; $a op= $b;"  This needs both a good test and a fix.

    Write documentation/examples for $function/$feature

    Others:
        come up with a (generated) index file for http://u4x.perl6.org/,
        awesomeify 

=head1 SCHEDULE

We don't have to keep the schedule to the day (but it would be nice). We
plan one task per week.
