=head2 subset

Declares a subtype of a type, that is a collection of instances of that type
which adhere to a given condition.

 my subset Positive of Num where { $^n > 0 };
 my Positive $p;
 $p = 10;   # WORKS
 $p = -42;  $ FAILS

This subtype can then be referred to anywhere an ordinary class or role can.

You cannot instantiate subtypes. That is, this doesn't work:

 my Positive $p .= new;

To export a subset type, put the export trait just before the C<where>:

    subset DNA of Str is export where { all(.comb) eq 'A'|'C'|'G'|'T' };
