=head1 The C<@> Sigil

The C<@> L<sigil> implies that the variable does the L<Positional>
L<role>, and in a declaration of a variable it defaults to instantiating
an object of class C<Array>.

=head1 The C<^> Twigil

=for STD twigil:sym<^>

Variables with the C<^> L<twigil> are considered positional parameters of the
current block. If multiple variables with such a twigil appear within the
same block, they are filled with arguments in the lexicographic order of their
names. So

    { say "$^b $^a $^c" }.(1, 2, 3)

Will say C<2 1 3>. It is illegal to use self-declared parameters inside a
block that already has an explicit signature, or that is the body of a
L<routine>.

The C<^> twigil is required only at the first occurrence of the
variable, so you can write

    @list.sort: { $^b <=> $^a - $b }

Where both C<$^b> and C<$b> refer to the second positional parameter of
that block.
