STD_green is a STD.pm-based parser for elf, written in p6.

It is not clear there will actually be a STD_green_run executable.
At present, STD_green is instead a project forcing factor.

Success looks like:
- STD_blue can parse STD.pm.
- elfblue can generate IR for STD.pm.
- an elf can run the non-rx portions of STD.pm.
- rx_on_re can run the rx portions of STD.pm.
- rx_on_re is integrated into an elf.
- an elf can run STD.pm
- an elf can self-compile using STD.pm.
