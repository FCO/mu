This file contains a list of tickets (bug reports) from rt.perl.org which were
closed after suspending support for Parrot in 2015-02. At the time when those
tickets where closed, they where only relevant for Rakudo on Parrot.

In case support for Parrot will be restored in some future release the listed
tickets can be checked and re-opened as appropriate.
