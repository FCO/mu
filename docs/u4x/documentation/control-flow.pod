=head3 if

Tests a condition and runs a block of code if the condition is found to be
true.

 if $day ~~ Saturday {
     say "It's Saturyday";
 }

The block can optionally be followed by any number of C<elsif> keywords
(each with their own condition and block), and optionally ended by an C<else>
keyword (also with a block):

 if $day ~~ Monday..Friday {
     say "It's a weekday";
 }
 elsif $day ~~ Saturday {
     say "It's Saturday";
 }
 else {
     say "It's Sunday";
 }

If you find yourself comparing the same expression against many different
things, consider using C<given> and C<when> instead. (XXX: Make the example
not contain that very mistake.)

The C<if> keyword evaluates junctions as if they're booleans.

 if any(True, False) {
     say "This gets printed.";
 }

There's also the statement-modifier C<if>. See its item for more information.
(XXX: Find a good way to link to statement-modifier C<if>.)
