From a blog post:

The official goal of the Userdocs For Christmas project (U4X) shall be to
provide easy-to-access comprehensive user documentation, through a ridiculously
easy-to-access command line tool, providing snippets of Perl 6 clarification so
perfectly worded and so brilliantly illustrative that the unsuspecting reader
will be brought close to tears.

The documentation writing itself will be done in a controlled manner, where
"con trolled" means that people with tuits get to make sure that things are
consisten t. All the documentation will be written in Pod, the Perl 6 version
of POD.
