 Tadzik's ideas:
 – compiler hacking
 – traits (sub foo is something(blah blah) {})
 – reference of types and its methods (something about gradual typing as well, or in another post?)
 – module system
 – about the Perl 6 Itself: specification, not an implementation, this is Rakudo, this is Niecza, this is Parrot
 – The Perl 6 Way (we tend to use lazy lists quite often, in example)

Moritz's ideas:
 – MAIN and USAGE subs (moritz)
 – sequence operator (colomon volunteers)
 – explaining one or more Perl 6 solutions on rosettacode
 – lexical subs and importing/exporting (moritz)
 – is everything a reference?
 – Z and X meta operators (moritz)
 – basic parsing: what is a term, what is an operator? why is the distinction important? (moritz)
 – MOP (moritz)
 – The Perl 6 community
 – infrastructure (what editors/IDEs are good for Perl 6 hacking/have syntax hilighting, tools used for hacking and presentations etc.)

 p6-users@ ideas:
 – sorear's fibers, laziness
 – new way to do IO
 – A natural language data/time parser could show off grammars.

sorear's ideas:
 – Beautiful secrets of the regex engine
 – What is flattening-ness?
 – gather and coroutines are equal in power
 – Binding and ties
 – Cool new feature: Builtin functions
 
colomon's ideas:
 - Feel very strongly we need a "How to get Rakudo * post" first (maybe combined with an update on the state of the p6 world)
 - Christmas carol notation using the ABC module
