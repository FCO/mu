This is a standalone version of elf on perl5.

It is assembled from the gimme5/STD.pm parser (in src/perl6/),
stdblue (elf_h plus AST handling for above), and a piece of STD_blue_run.

DEVELOPMENT QUICKSTART

$ make
$ perl -cw test.pl  # why isn't this working?

The current sticking point is getting the 4 perl5 files of the gimme5
implementation to continue working when combined into a single perl5
file.  Currently don't.  A volunteer is needed to pursue.

#for faster compiles, don't forget to  export STD_RED_CACHEDIR=./somedir

QUICKSTART (Vision - doesn't currently work)

$ sudo cpan -i YAML::Syck Moose  Carp File::Copy LazyMap Term::ANSIColor Encode Storable
$ wget http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/elfish/gimme_elf/elfg5 #XXX too big
$ chmod a+x elfg5
$ ./elfg5 -e 'say 3'
$ ./elfg5 -e 'say 3'

OBJECTIVE

Make it very easy to "get a taste of elf".
Just download a single file from the web, install some cpan, and done.

DEVELOPMENT

This is an elfblue, with STD_blue_run and src/perl6/mumbles inlined.
