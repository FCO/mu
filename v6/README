'v6' is a Perl 6 compiler written in plain perl6.

This is not the perl5 v6-alpha, see perl5/Pugs-Compiler-Perl6 for that.


There are currently 3 active subprojects:

- v6-MiniPerl6 is a subset of Perl 6 used to bootstrap the full Perl 6.

- v6-KindaPerl6 is a full Perl 6 implementation, currently written mostly in MiniPerl6.

- smop is a C implementation of the Perl 6 runtime.

- ironperl is a C# implementation of a Perl 6 runtime, on the tycho VM
    (which is in turn on the Mono VM, Novell's edition of the CLI, the
    Common Language Infrastructure).  Mono's gmcs compiles the C# to CIL
    (Common Intermediate Language), and the mono command (JITS and)
    executes the CIL on the (stack-based) mono VM.

Inactive projects are under misc/
