=head1 IDEAS

    Fix up a test file
        - S05-grammar/parse_and_parsefile.t assumes that YourGrammar.parse is
          not anchored. That's a wrong assumption => fix it

    Port a smallish module
        - ...

    Implement $smallish_feature in $implementation

    Fix $bug in $implementation
        - Right now, Rakudo fails to handle the case when &infix:<op>() doesn't exist
        and you do "my $a; $a op= $b;"  This needs both a good test and a fix.

    Write documentation/examples for $function/$feature

    Others:
        Write a website that gathers module URLs from proto's project.list,
        parsers their descriptions (from the github pages) and displays all
        of that in a nice list.

=head1 SCHEDULE

We don't have to keep the schedule to the day (but it would be nice). We
plan one task per week.
