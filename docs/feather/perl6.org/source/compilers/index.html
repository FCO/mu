    <h2>Perl&nbsp;6 Compilers</h2>

    <p>Perl 6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

    <h3>Compilers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> is based on the <a
            href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot virtual machine</a>. It
            is developed very actively. <a
            href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">Download or compile
            Rakudo</a>, <a href="http://rakudo.org/status">status</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/STD.pm6">STD.pm</a>
            is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
            parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
            abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
            Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by "gimme5", and supported by
            Cursor.pm and Moose and others.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?smop">SMOP</a>
            is a runtime library to represent Perl&nbsp;6 objects. It focuses on the
            meta object programming capabilities. It is actively developed.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a
            href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?mildew">Mildew</a>
            uses STD.pm as a parser and SMOP as runtime. It is actively developed.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a>, also known as MiniPerl6,
            is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
            You can <a href="http://www.perlito.org/js">try it online</a>.
            It is actively developed.

            <a
            href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/announcing-sprixel.html">Sprixel</a>
            uses JavaScript to compile Perl&nbsp;6 to JavaScript, with a runtime written in JavaScript. Recently, an STD.pm-compatible parser-generator was being written. It is actively developed.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Elf">Elf</a> is a bootstrapped
            compiler with Perl&nbsp;5 and Lisp backends. Only very little activity
            since March 2009.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> is written in Haskell, and has been inactive in the pugscode repository since mid 2007, but new releases for successive versions of ghc are published to <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">Hackage</a>. The most recent (6.2.13.15 as of this writing) was released 2009-12-16.
