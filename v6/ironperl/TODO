Please, anyone claim these tasks by committing your IRC
name next to them...

1. redo compile sh script as a Makefile (generator, if you like)

2. Or, make a Configure.pl, with an option --gen-mono that builds
mono from svn.  (see rakudo's --gen-parrot for inspiration)

3. Refactor out the gmcs compile command to build separate DLLs,
so that the entirety of the .cs does not need to be built every
time.  The build time for me is only a few seconds, but it would
be nice to reduce that to less than a second.

4. Add more items to this list. :)
