[% setvar title The Joy of Six %]

<p>Yeah, yeah, we know. We should already be finished. We should have
gotten things done. You're all giddy with anticipation. We are too.</p>

<p>Think about Rakudo * as, well, feature foreplay. Until you get the
real deal, you'll dance around it, do some "programming by teasing";
while you can't have the real feature (yet), you'll have to work
around it. That's mean, we know.</p>

<p>But it also means you learn a lot more about the language than just
getting straight to the proper solution.  It'll also teach you patience
and searching for just another idea how to solve problem X or Y.</p>

<p>It's also true though that certain things just can't be coded right
now, because you can't work around something essential missing.</p>

<p>On the other hand: Maybe getting your feet wet will encourage you to
participate by adding the missing essentials?</p>

<p>If you have doubts whether you want to give Six some love - just try
it, we basically guarantee new heights of joy and pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Really talking programming. We promise. Honestly.  :)</em></p>
