This file contains miscellaneous questions about design+spec
that Pm has come up with that are awaiting answers from TimToady
and/or others.  We'll likely record the answers here as well.

Pm-1:  In STD.pm, what is the semantic or key difference between <noun>
    and <term>?

Pm-2:  Are calls to subrules in other grammars still valid as
    C<<  / abc <OtherGrammar::xyz> def / >> ?  If so, then 
    for the invocation of the subrule, do we construct a new
    cursor of type OtherGrammar and invoke the 'xyz' method on it?
    (Pm's preference is "yes" and "yes", but want confirmation.)

Pm-3:  When we generate a metaop, where does it live?  Lexical?
    Package?  If package, then what package?

Pm-4:  The C<.ast> method on a Match object returns the matched
    text if no abstract object has been set.  Is there (or should
    there be) a method to determine if an abstract object has been
    set?  (Currently I'm using C<.peek_ast> in nqp-rx for this.)
