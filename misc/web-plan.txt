What you need for developing web stuff:

* HTTP::Request
* HTTP::Response
* A HTTP server, or an interface to one (CGI/FastCGI/PSGI/...). Preferably both.
  - HTTP::Easy works quite well, and the code is simple and hackable
* Cookies
* Sessions
* HTML template
  - There is Ratel, living in Bailador's repo as for now. Not perfect, but working and doing its job.
* URI handling
  - The URI module is in a good shape, aside from not working on nom.
* DB connectivity
* A MVC-ish framework
* Caching

low priority:

* a paging helper
* form helper
