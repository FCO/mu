TODO for perl6-projects.org:

GENERAL

* Items in each box could be sorted by likely reader interest / current project
  activity level / something. (Example: #perl6 IRC first in "Community")


CSS/LAYOUT

* add base font size & change font specs from points to ems

* block element widths shouldn't generally be specified in terms of font size
  (this means: change width: Xem; -> width: X% or Xpx  on divs)

* download button should NOT be moved up top; would be missing the
  (visual) point, hehe :)
