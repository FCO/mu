This is the pugs repository, but is nowadays a generic repository for hosting
anything related to Perl 6. In particular, it contains the synopsis
(specification), test suite, standard grammar, some implementations like SMOP,
mildew, v6 and elf, various Perl 6 examples, documentation efforts and examples.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to to ask on the
irc://irc.freenode.org/#perl6 IRC channel, or send an email to either
perl6-users@perl.org or perl6-compilers.org. Do the same to obtain a commit
bit for this repository.

Once you have commit access, you can also invite others via the web interface
at <http://commitbit.pugscode.org/admin/project/Pugs/people>.

Policy
======

We are rather liberal with what you can do here.
The only limitations are: be friendly, stay on topic (projects in here should
be related to Perl 6 in some way), only put free software in here, 

All code and documentation in this repository is considered as shared, so you
are free to improve and enhance other people's code, and you should be open to
contributions from others.
