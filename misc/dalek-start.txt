So you want to start up dalek?  Ok.

1. Log into feather3.perl6.nl under account p6eval.  I like sudo -iu for this,
   but it's up to you.

2. 'tmux attach' or 'tmux', whichever works.  'screen' would work too, but I
   prefer tmux.

3. Start the 2 parts of dalek in separate windows:

3a: The IRC component:
    cd ~/dalek; while true; do perl botnix --debug; sleep 30; done

3c: The pull component:
    cd ~/dalek/dalek-poller; perl poll

4. Detach and log out.
