Notes:
  
  - The layout is intended to look like the temple thingy in
    the Rakudo.org logo.
    
  - If you intend to change the layout, consider what happens when:
    * user's viewport is small (e.g. 800x600)
    * user resizes window

  - Test layout changes on browsershots.org, with particular consideration
    to badly broken browsers - IE6 still needs to be considered (2009-07).
    IE5.5 and below can be ignored.
    
  - jquery.min.js is in repo, i find i end up using it most of the time anyway
  
  - other javascript stuff could go in page.js (at your discretion).
