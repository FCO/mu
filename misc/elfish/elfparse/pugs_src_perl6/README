This is a temporary fork of the STD/gimme5 parser in <pugs>/src/perl6/ .
Elf fell behind HEAD.  This directory allows more flexible and easier chasing
after HEAD, than would working linearly through the revisions since then.

*LOG*
r25030  Baseline.
 -      Removed duplicate defs of infix:sym<andthen> and infix:sym<orelse>.
        Also fixed in HEAD.
